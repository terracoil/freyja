## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure
```python
def test_function_name():
    """Test description."""
    # Arrange
    input_data = "test"
    
    # Act
    result = function_under_test(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_value
```

### Test Coverage
- Aim for >90% test coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Include integration tests for CLI behavior

## Code Style

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 (enforced by Black)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions focused and small

### Type Hints
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Union

def process_data(
    input_file: str,
    output_format: str = "json",
    filters: Optional[List[str]] = None
) -> Union[dict, str]:
    """Process data with optional filters."""
    pass
```

### Docstrings
```python
def example_function(param1: str, param2: int = 10) -> bool:
    """
    Brief description of function.
    
    Longer description if needed, explaining behavior,
    edge cases, or important details.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2 with default
        
    Returns:
        Description of return value
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: When param1 is empty
        
    Example:

        True
    """
    pass
```
