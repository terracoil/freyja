# Code Quality Improvements and modgud Integration

## Summary

This PR introduces significant code quality improvements across the Freyja codebase, including the integration of modgud 1.2.0 for guard clause management, enforcement of single return-point patterns, and comprehensive refactoring to improve maintainability and testability.

## Key Changes

### üéØ modgud Integration (v1.2.0)

- Added modgud as a git submodule at `freyja/utils/modgud/`
- Integrated `@guarded_expression` decorator for clean guard clause management
- Converted key modules to use declarative guard patterns with implicit returns:
  - `completion/installer.py` - Replaced 12 early returns with dictionary dispatch pattern
  - `completion/base.py` - Eliminated 8-9 early returns across multiple methods
  - `freyja_cli.py` - Fixed return statement placement
  - `cli/execution_coordinator.py` - Standardized 8+ methods to single return points

### üìê Code Quality Improvements

#### Single Return Point Enforcement
- **31+ violations fixed** across core modules
- All methods now follow single return-point pattern as per coding standards
- Improved code readability and reduced complexity
- Better error handling flow through result variables

#### Architectural Improvements
- Replaced long if/elif chains with dictionary dispatch patterns
- Eliminated early returns inside conditional blocks
- Standardized error handling across modules
- Improved separation of concerns in execution flow

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

#### Renamed `bin/dev-tools` ‚Üí `bin/devtools`
- Updated all references throughout the codebase
- Improved command naming consistency
- Updated documentation to reflect new naming

#### Enhanced Build & Test Tools
- Improved test discovery and execution
- Better linting integration
- Updated pre-commit hooks configuration

### üß™ Test Infrastructure

#### Test Directory Reorganization

- Improved test organization and discoverability
- Better separation of unit, integration, and feature tests
- Added comprehensive test coverage for new guard patterns

#### Test Improvements
- All 636 tests passing ‚úÖ
- Enhanced test utilities in `tests/utils/test_helpers.py`
- Better test isolation and fixture management
- Improved test documentation

### üìö Documentation

#### New Documentation
- Added `docs/features/guards.md` - Comprehensive guard clause documentation
- Added `docs/how-it-works.md` - Detailed architecture documentation
- Added `docs/api-docs.md` - Complete API reference
- Added `docs/development/submodules.md` - Git submodule management guide

#### Updated Documentation
- Refreshed all getting-started guides
- Updated API reference with latest patterns
- Improved examples with guard clause patterns
- Enhanced troubleshooting guides

### üîß Configuration Updates

#### Project Configuration
- Updated `pyproject.toml` with new dependencies
- Added `ruff.toml` for linting configuration
- Updated `.pylintrc` with refined rules
- Improved `.gitignore` for better exclusions

#### Git Submodules
- Added `.gitmodules` configuration for modgud
- Documented submodule update procedures

All changes maintain backward compatibility:
- Public API unchanged
- CLI behavior unchanged
- Test interfaces preserved
- Configuration options preserved

## Benefits

### Code Maintainability
- **~55 lines removed** through refactoring
- Clearer control flow with single return points
- Better guard clause organization
- Reduced cognitive complexity

### Developer Experience
- Consistent guard pattern usage across codebase
- Better error messages through modgud integration
- Improved code review clarity
- Easier to test and debug

### Code Quality
- **31+ single return violations fixed**
- More predictable execution flow
- Better error handling patterns
- Improved test coverage

## Testing

- ‚úÖ All 636 tests passing
- ‚úÖ No regressions detected
- ‚úÖ Integration tests verified
- ‚úÖ Example scripts tested

## Files Changed

**Core Modules** (4 major refactorings):
- `freyja/completion/installer.py` - Guard pattern implementation
- `freyja/completion/base.py` - Single return enforcement
- `freyja/freyja_cli.py` - Execution flow improvements
- `freyja/cli/execution_coordinator.py` - Comprehensive refactoring

**Supporting Changes**:
- Test reorganization: `freyja/tests/` ‚Üí `tests/`
- Tool renaming: `bin/dev-tools` ‚Üí `bin/devtools`
- Documentation: 7+ new/updated docs
